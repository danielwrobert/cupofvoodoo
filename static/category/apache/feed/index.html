										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a developer, there may be times when you need to monitor what is happening on an Apache server as live HTTP requests are coming in from a web page. In a UNIX environment, you can actually accomplish this quite painlessly through the command line, using the <code>tail</code> and <code>grep</code> commands. <code>Tail</code> is a command which outputs the last part of a file and the <code>grep</code> utility is used for pattern matching.</p>

<p>First, you will want to locate your Apache logs and <code>cd</code> into that directory. If you are running a local server through MAMP, you can most likely find them in the application folder.</p>

<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">cd /Applications/MAMP/logs</pre>

<span id="more-371"></span>

<p>If you are running the Apache server that is preinstalled on OS X, you should be able to find them from the var folder in the root directory.</p>

<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">cd /var/log/apache2</pre>

<p>Once you&#8217;ve found where your log files are located, you can monitor them using the <code>tail</code> command, as mentioned above. From the directory where the log files live, run the following command:</p>

<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">tail -f apache_access.log</pre>

<p>The <code>-f</code> flag makes the <code>tail</code> command output additional data as it is appended to the log. <code>Tail</code> can also be piped through <code>grep</code> to pattern match and filter your output results. This way you won&#8217;t get such a potentially large output and will be able to pinpoint what you are looking for more easily.</p>

<pre class="brush: bash; title: ; notranslate">tail -f apache_access.log | grep -i someusefulpattern</pre>

<p>The <code>-i</code> flag in the above <code>grep</code> command will ignore case distinctions in both the pattern and the input files. You can also run the manual from the command line for a full list of options on each utility and use whatever variation best suits your scenario.</p>

<p>So there you have it &#8211; with just a short, one line command in your Terminal, you can easily monitor the HTTP requests on your Apache web server as they are happening.</p>]]></content:encoded>
