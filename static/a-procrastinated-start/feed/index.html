					<description><![CDATA[Seriously though, awesome! I&#039;ve been in this exact same boat for awhile, talking about a blog but never doing it. You got some good points here Dan&#039;O about being a Nike and &quot;Just do it&quot;.

I think your point about feeling that they&#039;re so many other talented developers out there and feeling under qualified really sums up why I don&#039;t voice my self very much.

My Tumblr feed has so many unpublished bits of knowledge that I&#039;ve learned and simply put down for reference later. I really need to get some of that stuff out there.]]></description>
